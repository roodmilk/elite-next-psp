# Changelog

All notable playable releases are recorded here. `VERSION` is the current canonical version.

## 2.5.5 - 2026-09-22

- Speaker labels (`KEI SAYS`, `IONA SAYS`, flight chatter, Law stops) now sit on a colour chip matching the speaker.
- Tracked Mission briefings show the active speaker's face beside the dialogue bubble for saga chapters and Guild assignments.
- Outfitting detail pane explains tech gates in plain language: in stock, already fitted, or hub tech too low with the needed level and “warp to a richer system.”
- Galacticnet tab order is News / Market / Wanted / Spacebook / Messages / Jobs; Spacebook and Messages show a Facebook-parody logo.
- Discovery Codex adds Systems (visited) and Planets (worlds discovered by visiting a system).
- Radio page is a tuner dial with OFF + stations 1–5, static while retuning, and Triangle power off.
- Each system rotates planet types/colours and traffic layout; hyperspace drops you farther from the hub on a system-unique bearing.
- Double-tap L hard-brakes when fast; heat rises from speed, boost and sun proximity — critical heat locks boost, max heat destroys the ship.
- Hold Start adjusts SYS/ENG/WEP on the existing cockpit meters (no separate overlay). Mission cue is right-aligned; wanted level shows under the system name; Select deck preview is a third-person ship view.

## 2.5.4 - 2026-09-22

- Fixed black screen after PSP sleep/standby (especially long sleeps): freeze MP3 I/O on suspend, then fully rebuild display, controls and radio on resume.
- Switched framebuffer presentation to `NEXTFRAME` after vblank for more reliable hardware display recovery.
- Shortened audio teardown timeout and terminate-delete the worker if it is stuck on Memory Stick wake.
- Smoke exercises a double suspend/resume recover path; physical PSP confirmation still required.

## 2.5.3 - 2026-09-22

- Saved the final galaxy-map route goal separately from the immediate hyperspace hop (save format 10; older commanders still import).
- After each jump, the next hop toward that saved goal is refreshed automatically until arrival clears it.
- Nearby/galaxy UI shows `FINAL` / route-goal labels for manual multi-jump plans as well as tracked story destinations.
- Added journey/input regressions for plot, save/load, intermediate advance and arrival clear.

## 2.5.2 - 2026-09-22

- Added user-supplied radio station folders and shuffled MP3 playback on PSP.
- Improved MP3 playback stability and PSP suspend/resume recovery.
- Kept generated radio audio as a fallback when a station has no compatible tracks.
- Added mission availability checks so objectives point to stations that can actually offer the required contract.
- Expanded galaxy navigation planning so distant destinations can be located and routed through intermediate systems.
- Preserved the current UI, mission, faction, targeting, dialogue, art, and gameplay work documented in `README.md` and `CLAUDE-HANDOFF.md`.

## 2.5.1 and earlier

The detailed development history, controls, implemented feature list, validation notes, and future design plan are retained in `README.md`, `docs/`, and the Git commit history.
